      <h2>What is Water Scarcity?</h2>
      <p>
        Water scarcity means there is not enough clean and safe water available to meet the needs of people, animals, and the environment. It affects how communities live, grow food, and maintain hygiene. Without sufficient water, it becomes difficult to support basic human activities such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, and farming.
        In simple terms, it happens when the demand for water is greater than the amount available in a particular area or during a certain time. This can occur because of natural reasons, like droughts and dry climates, or human activities, such as pollution, overuse of water, and poor water management. As populations grow and industries expand, the demand for water increases, putting even more pressure on limited water sources.
        Water scarcity is a serious global issue that not only threatens health and food security but also impacts economic development and the balance of ecosystems. Therefore, managing water resources wisely and conserving water are essential to ensure that future generations will also have access to this vital resource.

      <h2>Main Causes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Climate change has caused changes in global weather patterns, making some regions experience longer and more frequent droughts. These droughts reduce rainfall and dry up rivers, lakes, and groundwater sources. As a result, less water is available for people, animals, and plants. In some areas, rising temperatures also increase evaporation, further worsening water shortages.</li>
        <li>Many freshwater sources, such as rivers, lakes, and underground water, are being polluted by human activities. Factories release harmful chemicals, farms use pesticides and fertilizers that wash into rivers, and household waste often ends up in water systems. This pollution makes the water unsafe for drinking, cooking, or irrigation, reducing the amount of clean water available for use.</li>
        <li>Agriculture and industry are two major users of water. In farming, a large amount of water is needed to grow crops and raise livestock. However, much of this water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation systems. Similarly, factories use huge amounts of water for cooling, cleaning, and production. When these sectors overuse water without proper recycling or conservation, it leads to depletion of natural water sources.</li>
        <li>In many places, the problem is not a lack of water, but poor systems to collect, store, and distribute it. Old or leaking pipes, weak water supply networks, and lack of proper planning cause a lot of water to be lost before it even reaches people’s homes. Corruption and mismanagement in water authorities can also prevent fair distribution of water resources, leaving some communities without access to clean water.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Effects on Life</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Millions suffer due to unsafe water." <br>
        — UNICEF
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>When clean water is scarce, people are often forced to use contaminated water sources for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. This leads to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. Poor sanitation caused by lack of water also makes it easier for germs and bacteria to spread, putting entire communities at risk of serious health problems and even death.</li>
        <li>Water scarcity directly affects agriculture, as crops and livestock depend on a steady supply of water to grow. Without enough water for irrigation, plants wither and die, leading to crop failures and reduced food production. This can cause hunger, malnutrition, and higher food prices, especially in rural areas where farming is the main source of income.</li>
        <li>Rivers, lakes, and wetlands are home to many species of plants and animals. When these water sources dry up, entire ecosystems are destroyed. Aquatic life such as fish, amphibians, and plants die out, while land animals lose their habitats and food sources. Over time, this results in a loss of biodiversity, upsetting the balance of nature and weakening ecosystems.</li>
        <li>As water becomes scarce, people may be forced to migrate from dry areas to places with more reliable water supplies. This can lead to overcrowding and strain on resources in those regions. In extreme cases, competition for limited water can cause conflicts between communities or even countries. Disputes over river usage or shared water sources have already become a major issue in some parts of the world.</li>

      <h2>How can YOU help?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the most effective ways to fight water scarcity is by using water wisely at home. Simple actions like turning off the tap while brushing teeth, fixing leaking pipes, taking shorter showers, and using water-saving appliances can make a big difference. Recycling greywater used water from washing or bathing for cleaning or gardening can also help reduce overall water consumption. Every drop saved contributes to conserving this precious resource.</li>
        <li>Many local and global organizations are working hard to provide clean and safe water to communities in need. You can support their efforts by donating money, volunteering time, or helping to raise awareness about their work. These organizations often build wells, purify water sources, and teach sustainable water management, helping people in water-scarce areas live healthier lives.</li>
        <li>Education plays a key role in solving water scarcity. By sharing knowledge about the importance of saving water and the effects of water pollution, you can inspire others to take action. Schools, social media, and community programs are great platforms to spread awareness. When more people understand the problem, they are more likely to change their habits and join in conservation efforts.</li>
        <li>Joining local river, lake, or beach clean-up activities helps protect freshwater sources from pollution. Collecting plastic waste and other garbage prevents them from entering and contaminating waterways. These events also encourage community cooperation and environmental responsibility. By taking part, you help ensure that local water sources remain clean, safe, and sustainable for everyone.</li>
